**LightThreads** is a compact notebook for **engine design**, **GPU/CPU/memory profiling**, **PBR**, **ray tracing**, and **practical performance work**⚡

What I plan to write about:

- 🛠️ **Software engineering for rendering engines**: APIs, modular design, maintainability, and pragmatic release strategies.
- ⚙️ **Engine systems and trade-offs** for high-performance games and real-time applications.
- ⚡ **GPU-aware performance work**: memory layout, bandwidth vs compute trade-offs, batching, and caching.
- 🎨 **Physically based rendering and light transport**: useful patterns for PBR, sampling, and denoising.
- ✨ **Ray tracing pipelines**: getting quality where it matters without breaking the frame budget.
- 🔍 **Profiling, shader tuning**, and small tooling that makes performance work repeatable.
