LightThreads is a compact notebook for engine design, GPU/CPU/memory profiling, PBR, ray tracing, and practical performance work — short posts and reproducible experiments I can share.

What I plan to write about:

- Software engineering for rendering engines: APIs, modular design, maintainability, and pragmatic release strategies.
- Engine systems and trade-offs for high-performance games and real-time applications.
- GPU-aware performance work: memory layout, bandwidth vs compute trade-offs, batching, and caching.
- Physically based rendering and light transport: useful patterns for PBR, sampling, and denoising.
- Ray tracing and hybrid pipelines: getting quality where it matters without breaking the frame budget.
- Profiling, shader tuning, and small tooling that makes performance work repeatable.
