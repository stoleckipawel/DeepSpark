# LightThreads (minimal)

This repository hosts a minimal Hugo site for LightThreads. Public site surface is intentionally small: only the `About` page and posts. Navigation contains direct links to the author's GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.

Where to add posts:

- `content/posts/<slug>/index.md`

Site config and theme overrides live in `config/` and `config/_default/`.

To commit and publish changes, push to `main`. A GitHub Actions workflow will build and deploy the Pages site.

If you need help adding a post or restoring an archive copy of removed sections, tell me and I can help recover them from local history if available.
